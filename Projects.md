# Interactive Dashboard for Data Annotation
Our project harnesses the power of Dash, a productive Python framework for building web applications, to create an intuitive and efficient data annotation dashboard. Designed for teams and individuals working with large datasets, our solution simplifies the complex process of data labeling and annotation through a highly interactive, user-friendly interface.

## Key Features:
- **Customizable User Interface**: Leveraging Dash’s flexibility, our application provides a highly adaptable layout, allowing users to tailor the interface to meet specific data annotation requirements.
- **Real-Time Data Interaction**: Users can easily interact with data visualizations, filter data points, and update annotations on the fly, making the process of data exploration seamless.
- **Collaboration and User Management**: Built-in support for multiple user roles and permissions enables collaborative annotation efforts, keeping track of changes and user-specific contributions.
- **Automated Annotation Suggestions**: Integrates machine learning models to suggest annotations and reduce manual effort, speeding up the data labeling process.
- **Comprehensive Metrics and Tracking**: The dashboard offers analytical insights into annotation progress, user performance, and data distribution, facilitating a complete understanding of the annotation workflow.
- **Scalability and Performance Optimization**: Optimized to handle large-scale datasets efficiently, ensuring smooth performance even as the data complexity increases.

## Technology Stack:
- **Dash Framework**: Core technology for developing the interactive web interface.
- **Plotly**: Employed for dynamic, high-quality data visualizations, enhancing user engagement and understanding.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: Used for efficient data manipulation and backend processing.
- **Flask Server Integration**: Facilitates seamless handling of user requests and data transactions.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Incorporated to automate annotation tasks or improve workflow efficiency.
- **Docker for Local Hosting**: Docker containers are used to package the entire application, making it easy to deploy and run the dashboard locally on any system. This setup ensures consistent performance and eliminates environment configuration issues.

Our application is designed to streamline the data annotation process while maintaining a high level of customization and flexibility. Whether you are working with text, images, or numerical data, our dashboard equips you with the necessary tools to annotate, review, and manage data efficiently.

# AI-Powered Chatbot for Personalized Diet Planning Using RAG
Our project leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an advanced approach in natural language processing, to develop an intelligent chatbot that delivers personalized diet plans. By incorporating user-specific metadata—such as location, health conditions, and dietary preferences—our chatbot provides tailored nutrition advice, enhancing user experience and engagement.

## Key Features:
- **Personalized Diet Recommendations**: The chatbot uses RAG to combine pre-trained language models with a dynamic retrieval system. This enables the generation of diet plans that are customized based on the user’s health profile, including medical conditions, allergies, and dietary goals.
- **Metadata Integration**: The system seamlessly integrates user metadata, such as geographical location (to recommend locally available food options), health conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart health), and personal preferences (e.g., vegan, gluten-free). This ensures that recommendations are both practical and effective.
- **Context-Aware Conversations**: With RAG, the chatbot intelligently retrieves relevant information from a comprehensive database of nutritional knowledge, providing accurate and context-aware responses in real time.
- **Adaptive Learning**: The chatbot learns from user interactions to continuously improve recommendations, fine-tuning diet plans based on feedback and evolving health data.
- **Nutritional Insights and Analysis**: The system offers in-depth insights into each diet plan, explaining nutritional benefits and how they align with the user's health goals, making it both informative and actionable.

## Technology Stack:
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines the power of retrieval mechanisms and generative language models to deliver high-quality, accurate responses.
- **Pre-Trained Language Models**: Utilizes cutting-edge NLP models to understand user queries and provide coherent, natural language responses.
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: A comprehensive repository of dietary information, medical guidelines, and localized food options serves as the foundation for retrieval.
- **Metadata Processing**: Advanced algorithms to analyze and integrate user metadata, ensuring recommendations are personalized and relevant.
- **Cloud-Based Deployment**: Easily deployable on cloud platforms to ensure scalability and optimal performance, with the flexibility to run locally if required.

Our RAG-powered chatbot offers a holistic approach to diet planning, making nutrition guidance accessible, personalized, and interactive. By considering the unique needs and contexts of each user, the chatbot aims to promote healthier living through practical and well-informed dietary choices.
